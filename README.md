Book Selection Decision Support System

This repository contains a VBA-coded Excel workbook that can be used as a decision support system for book selection. The system allows users to specify six criteria for book selection, and then ranks the books in the dataset according to those criteria.

To use the system, follow these steps:

Download the .rar file.
Extract the contents of the .rar file to a folder.
Open the Book_Selection_Decision_Support_System.xlsm workbook.
Click the "Find" button.
The system will then display a userform with six criteria fields, a list of books, and a graph that can be activated by clicking the "Preview Graph" button.

**The important thing to note is that the values entered in the criterion weight fields must add up to 1. For example, the following weight assignment would be valid:
Page Count: 0.12
Language: 0.48
Rating: 0.11
Review Count: 0.9
Price: 0.10
Sales Success: 0.10

The system will then rank the books in the dataset according to the specified criteria. The books with the highest scores will be ranked higher.

The system also includes a graph that shows the relationship between the criteria and the book scores. This graph can be helpful for visualizing the relative importance of each criterion.

The system is still under development, but it has the following features:

Six criteria for book selection
Ranking of books according to the specified criteria

Preview graph that shows the relationship between the criteria and the book scores
The following features are planned for future development:

Support for additional criteria
Ability to export the results to a CSV file
Ability to save the user's settings
We hope you find this system helpful for book selection.
